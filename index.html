    <h1>The Dollar Cost of Crony Capitalism</h1>
    <h4>James Totah</h4>
    <p>
      The issue of wage stagnation and corporate accountability on social, and
      environmental issues has been a hot topic in political discourse for quite
      some time. This project will provide visual representations of some key
      correlations. It will also provide me with a visual scheme to discuss
      these topics with unfamiliar laypersons in a more understandable way.

      From the social security administration, data was collected and aggregates of 
      the bottom 50% of earners and the top 1% of earners were made for each year available.
      A connected scatter plot was used, drawing attention to some otherwise overlooked features.
      For instance, in the middle of the chart, under the annotation we see the 2008 housing crisis
      that caused both top earners and bottom earners to lose income in those years indicated by the
      reversal of the direction of the line.

      Also from the data of the Social Security Administration, this is a graph of the average income,
      and the median income of Americans. A feature of this graph is that the average line is slowly
      diverging from the median line. In order to accentuate this, a median to average ratio point has 
      been added for every year available. What does this mean? The median is a much better indication
      of how most Americans are faring, and with the average increasing faster than the median, it 
      shows that mostly those making well above median incomes are increasing their compensation, and 
      quicker than most at the bottom.

      How then does the United States stack up against a few of the countries best known for labor
      rights and quality of life? Here we can see that this graph uses US data as the 0% indicator,
      and each country is measured up against the US. Most of these countries have a top marginal tax
      rate that is 25-50% higher that the US. In Finland, Iceland, and Sweden, the minimum wage
      effectively doesnt exist! High taxes and no minimum wage? How could anyone survive? Looking at
      both median and average incomes, all of these countries are faring quite well. The answer lies
      in the last option, union membership rates, and the power afforded to collective bargaining in
      these countries.

      What about some of the biggest issues of our time? Here we have the market cap of the 10 largest
      corperations in the world mapped onto axes. In red, are estimated dollar cost solutions to some
      of these issues. The climate change mitigation amount, the education amount, and the water amount
      are yearly figures, for example the climate change estimate is 100b a year for 2 decades. Obviously
      the money is not just sitting there to easily be taxed or appropriated to solving issues quickly.
      However, just like these solutions would take time, these massive corperations did not spring up 
      overnight. Each of these corperations took many years, and lots of hard work to build and amass 
      a market capitalization this high. So we see it is not an issue of capability to fix the worlds 
      problems. It is an issue of priorities. In a crony capitalist society, there is no longer an
      incentive to maintain humanity, as everything, and everyone, are fuel for the economy.
